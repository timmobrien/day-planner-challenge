# How it works

This app runs on JavaScript and makes use of j-query to manipulate the page. The bulk of the styling was all made with Bootstrap. Users are able to enter in a task for a particular time, before saving it to their local storage where it will persist when they next open the page. All future time blocks are dispolayed in green, the present block is red and past blocks are grey.
